# Stockholm-Cholera-Outbreak
Cholera Outbreak in Stockholm, 1853 Dataset Analysis
This dataset is part of research work on the history of Stockholm, the capital of Sweden in the 19th century. Since Sweden has well-preserved church archives this permits getting detailed information about e.g. pandemic events.

The initial challenge I encountered here was the language of the dataset column headings. I overcame this with the help of Google Translator.
